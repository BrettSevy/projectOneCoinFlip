# Project1

using rapid API we used a random joke generator and a coin flip API.
we used Giphy.com as a third parrty API for the gifs.
animate.cs for the animated "flipping" motion.

you click the "flip me" button and if the coin lands on heads you will receive a random joke.
if the coin lands on tails you will receive a random gif.
